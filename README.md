# Transfer-Learning-Based-Classification-of-Poultry-Diseases-for-Enhanced-Health-Management

🐔 **Poultry Disease Classification using Transfer Learning**

A deep learning-based application that classifies poultry diseases using image data and other environmental factors to support rapid, accurate diagnosis and improve poultry farm health management.

📌 **Project Title**

Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

📊 **Dataset**

**Source:** Collected poultry health image data and related information.

**Format:** Image files (JPG/PNG) with disease labels and metadata.

**Target Classes:**

•Salmonella

•New Castle Disease

•Coccidiosis

•Healthy

**Features:**

•Visual features from poultry images

•Environmental conditions

•Observed symptoms (e.g., lethargy, diarrhea, low egg production)

🛠️ **Technologies Used:**

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS (for web interface if applicable)

**Backend:** Python

**Deep Learning Model:** CNN using Transfer Learning (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)

**Libraries:** TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

**Deployment:** Mobile-ready integration (planned)


⚙️ **How It Works:**

•The user uploads poultry images or enters symptom details via an app/web form.

•The trained deep learning model processes the input and predicts the disease class.

•Based on the prediction, suggested treatments or management practices are displayed to the user.


🧠 **Model Details:**

**Model Type:** Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Transfer Learning:** Used to fine-tune a model like MobileNet or ResNet on poultry disease data

**Output:** 4-class classification – Salmonella, New Castle Disease, Coccidiosis, Healthy

**Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix


📱 **Use Case Scenarios:**

**1. Rural Community Outbreak**
Farmers input symptoms/images into the mobile app and receive a diagnosis (e.g., Coccidiosis) with treatment steps.

**2. Commercial Farm Monitoring**
Real-time health checks detect early signs of New Castle Disease, enabling immediate quarantine and control.

**3. Veterinary Student Training**
Students use the app for simulated diagnosis and treatment planning, enhancing practical learning.


✅ **Future Enhancements**

•Deploy the model as an Android/iOS app

•Add multilingual support for rural users

•Integrate SHAP or Grad-CAM for visual model explainability

•Expand dataset to include more diseases and edge cases
